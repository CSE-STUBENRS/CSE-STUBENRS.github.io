        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p1>Hi! I'm from Fort Mill SC, I am 21 years old and I am a freshman at The University of South Carolina.
            I took a gap year after high scholl and joined the US Army National Guard. I enjoy golfing, hanging out 
            with friends and playing sports. I am currently engaged and planning to get married. I have a younger brother
            who is 16 and a shzitzu named Daisy.
